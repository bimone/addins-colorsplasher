# Color Splasher

The Color Splasher is a tool initially developed by BIM One that allows to graphically visualize and verify the information in a model. It filters, selects and colors elements based on the values of a defined parameter to let you visualise if there are errors or a lack of information. User first selects the desired category, then selects a parameter and finally, sets colors for each value of this parameter.
