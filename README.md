> VISUALIZE AND VERIFY THE INFORMATION IN A MODEL WITH COLOUR

The Colour Splasher is a tool by BIM One that allows to graphically visualize and verify the information in a model. It filters, selects and colours elements based on the values of a defined parameter to let you visualise if there are errors or a lack of information. The user first selects the desired category, then selects a parameter, and finally, sets colours for each value of this parameter.

- Quick review of potential problems
- Facilitates monitoring of model quality
- Faster than creating view filters
